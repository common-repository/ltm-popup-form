Plugin to allow users to create and add a popup form easily on the website. 

== Description ==
This popup form allows user to add a popup form easily on their blog for high visibility.
That popup form will send emails to site admin, or configured address.

== Installation ==
1. From Plugin Upload 'ltm-popup-form.zip'

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I change the position of the popup? =

Of course, you can update the CSS easily and override whatever position you want for the popup button or the form itself.
I am working on additional configuration options currently.
